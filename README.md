## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a Responsive web, made mostley with html and css, with a little sprinkle of JavaScript for some details, made with the specifications and taste of the gym owner

## Optimizations

I personally like different pages for different sections, but as this web is focused on mobile users and just provide some info about the gym its ok.
There are also some little things about the responsiveness that could be better.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned a lot about SEO.
Every freelancing job helps me to understand how to work with clients, also this client wanted a web from scratch, with some tematic design and some little js features that were helpfull to learn as i've used them already in other projects.
